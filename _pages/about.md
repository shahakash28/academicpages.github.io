I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by [Prof. Rafail Ostrovsky](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/) at UCLA. I am interested in solving practically relevant questions of cryptography.

Formerly, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research (MSR) India, where I worked closely with [Dr. Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/) and [Dr. Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/). Prior to that, I completed my M.Tech (Research) in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Science (IISc) under the supervision of [Prof. Sanjit Chatterjee](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~sanjit/).
